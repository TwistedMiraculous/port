# Ionic Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up your Ionic project and run it locally using `ionic serve`. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to make sure that the following software is installed on your system:

1. **Node.js and npm**
   - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
   - npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js.

2. **Ionic CLI**
   - To install the Ionic CLI, open your terminal/command prompt and run:
     ```bash
     npm install -g @ionic/cli
     ```

3. **Angular (optional)**
   - If you haven't installed Angular globally, you can run:
     ```bash
     npm install -g @angular/cli
     ```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository (if applicable)**
   - If you haven't already cloned the repository, you can do so by running:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project:
     ```bash
     cd your-project
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - This will install all the dependencies listed in `package.json`.

## Running the Project

After you have installed the dependencies, you can run the project using the following steps:

1. **Serve the Project**
   - To serve the project and view it in your browser, run:
     ```bash
     ionic serve
     ```

2. **Access the Project in the Browser**
   - Once the command completes, your application should be running at the following address:
     ```
     http://localhost:8100
     ```
   - Open this URL in your web browser to view your app.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Dependencies**: If you encounter issues with missing packages, make sure you've run `npm install` and that you're in the correct directory.
- **Permission Errors**: If you run into permission issues when installing packages, you might need to use `sudo` (for Mac/Linux) or run your terminal as Administrator (for Windows).
- **Port Conflicts**: If port 8100 is already in use, you can change the port by running:
  ```bash
  ionic serve --port 8101
